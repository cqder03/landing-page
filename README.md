# landing-page
This is project initiated by The Odin Project curriculum and presents semi-modern website that looks something like website that are seen regularly.<br>
It showcases styling and positioning website using beginner level css and flexbox for positioning.<br>
Right now it's filled with random information and some pictures that are foundation of what website should look like in future <br> once my skill level is developer 
more so I can add funcionality to the page and more style.<br>
Finished in roughly 2-4hrs. I bit too long if you ask me but my expectations right now are not developed enough <br> 
to come to conclusion if this is too much or not for page of this level. <br>
